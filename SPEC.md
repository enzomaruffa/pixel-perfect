Image Processing Pipeline - Enhanced Design Specification
Executive Overview
A Python-based image processing framework that applies sophisticated pixel-level transformations through a composable pipeline architecture. The system treats images as RGBA data, uses Pydantic for strict parameter validation, and provides comprehensive early validation against actual image dimensions before any processing begins. Operations work at multiple granularities (pixel, row, column, block) and can be chained together to create complex artistic and practical effects.
Core Design Philosophy

Fail Fast, Fail Clear: Complete pipeline validation after image load, before any processing
Composable Operations: Simple operations combine into complex effects
Channel Aware: Full RGBA support with operations declaring channel requirements
Cache Smart: Automatic per-operation caching for iterative development
Developer First: Clear APIs, comprehensive validation, helpful error messages

Key Features

Multi-Granularity Operations: Work at pixel, row, column, or virtual block levels
Virtual Resolution: Treat high-res images as lower-res grids while preserving actual pixels
Mathematical Filters: Apply conditions based on indices (prime, odd, even, custom expressions)
Dimensional Transforms: Stretch, shift, and manipulate image geometry
Dry Run Mode: Validate entire pipeline without processing
Intelligent Caching: Hash-based caching of operation results for fast iteration

Core Architecture
ImageContext
Flows through the pipeline carrying accumulated state:
pythonclass ImageContext:
    width: int          # Current dimensions
    height: int
    channels: int       # 1 (grayscale), 3 (RGB), or 4 (RGBA)
    dtype: str          # uint8, float32, etc.
    warnings: List[str] # Non-fatal issues
    metadata: dict      # Optional EXIF, color profile, etc.
Operation Base Class
pythonclass BaseOperation:
    def validate(self, context: ImageContext) -> ImageContext:
        """Validate operation against current image state, return updated context"""

    def get_cache_key(self, image_hash: str) -> str:
        """Generate unique cache key for this operation"""

    def estimate_memory(self, context: ImageContext) -> int:
        """Estimate memory usage in bytes"""

    def apply(self, image: Image, context: ImageContext) -> Tuple[Image, ImageContext]:
        """Transform image and update context"""
Pipeline Class
Main orchestrator that:

Loads image and creates initial ImageContext
Runs validation pass through all operations (dry run capability)
Checks cache for each operation before executing
Executes operations with progress tracking
Manages debug output and final save

Operation Specifications

result = (pipeline
    # First, create a grid effect
    .add(BlockFilter(
        block_width=8,
        block_height=8,
        condition="checkerboard",
        fill_color=(0, 0, 0, 128)
    ))
    # Shift odd rows for glitch effect
    .add(RowShift(
        selection="odd",
        shift_amount=3,
        wrap=True
    ))
    # Keep only prime-indexed pixels in affected areas
    .add(PixelFilter(
        condition="prime",
        fill_color=(255, 0, 0, 255),
        index_mode="linear"
    ))
    # Stretch to Instagram square
    .add(AspectStretch(
        target_ratio="1:1",
        method="segment",
        segment_count=5,
        preserve_center=True
    ))
    .execute("output.png"))

# Complex geometric transformation
pipeline = Pipeline("input.jpg")
pipeline.add(ColumnStretch(factor=1.5, method="duplicate"))
pipeline.add(RowShift(selection="gradient", gradient_start=0, shift_amount=10))
pipeline.add(GridWarp(axis="horizontal", frequency=3, amplitude=20))

# Validation will catch errors early
try:
    result = pipeline.execute("warped.png", dry_run=True)  # Validation only
    if result.warnings:
        print(f"Warnings: {result.warnings}")
    result = pipeline.execute("warped.png")  # Actually process
except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Pipeline invalid: {e}")

# Using cache for iterative development
pipeline = Pipeline("test.jpg", cache_dir="./cache")
pipeline.add(ExpensiveOperation())  # Will cache result
pipeline.add(RowShift(shift_amount=2))  # Tweak this parameter
# Re-running will use cached result from ExpensiveOperation
result = pipeline.execute("output.png")
Testing Strategy
Synthetic Test Image Generation
pythondef create_test_images():
    # Numbered grid: each pixel value = row * width + col
    grid_8x8 = create_numbered_grid(8, 8)

    # Gradient for stretch testing
    gradient_h = create_gradient(8, 4, direction="horizontal")

    # Checkerboard for pattern operations
    checker = create_checkerboard(16, 16, square_size=4)

    # Single color channels for channel operations
    red_only = create_channel_test(8, 8, channels="r")

    # High frequency pattern for aliasing tests
    stripes = create_stripes(32, 32, width=1, orientation="vertical")
Operation Test Patterns
PixelFilter Prime Test:

Input: 4Ã—4 grid (pixels 0-15)
Expected: Pixels 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 preserved
Verify: Exact preservation, correct fill color

RowShift Wrap Test:

Input: 4Ã—4 with unique row values
Shift odd rows left by 1 with wrap
Verify: Circular shift on rows 1, 3 only

BlockFilter Division Test:

Input: 10Ã—10 image, 3Ã—3 blocks
Expected: Handles padding mode correctly
Verify: Edge blocks use specified padding

ColumnStretch Factor Test:

Input: 4Ã—4 pattern
Stretch 2Ã— horizontal
Verify: Each column duplicated exactly once

AspectStretch Segment Test:

Input: 15Ã—10 image
Target: 1:1 with 3 segments
Verify: Each segment stretched uniformly

Validation Test Cases

Dimension Validation: Row operations with out-of-bounds indices
Channel Requirements: Grayscale operation on RGBA image
Memory Limits: Extreme stretch factors
Block Divisibility: Non-even block sizes with crop/pad modes
Pipeline Consistency: Operations that would create 0Ã—0 result
Cache Integrity: Modified parameters trigger recalculation

Edge Cases to Test

1Ã—1 images (minimum valid)
Extreme aspect ratios (1Ã—1000)
Single channel images
Images with existing alpha
Operations resulting in >4GB memory usage
Prime numbers beyond image size
Negative shift amounts
Non-integer block positions
