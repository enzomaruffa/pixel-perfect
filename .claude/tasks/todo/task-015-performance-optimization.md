## Performance Optimization Areas

### Image Processing Optimizations
- **NumPy Vectorization**: Replace pixel-by-pixel operations with vectorized NumPy
- **Memory Views**: Use memory views to avoid unnecessary copying
- **In-Place Operations**: Modify images in-place where possible
- **Chunk Processing**: Process large images in chunks to manage memory

### Algorithm Improvements
- **Efficient Indexing**: Optimize pixel index calculations for filters
- **Fast Color Space Conversions**: Cached lookup tables for repeated conversions
- **Interpolation Optimization**: SIMD-optimized interpolation for geometric operations
- **Block Processing**: Optimize block operations with efficient memory access patterns

### Memory Management
```python
class MemoryManager:
    def estimate_operation_memory(self, operation, context) -> int
    def check_memory_availability(self, required_bytes) -> bool
    def suggest_chunk_size(self, image_size, available_memory) -> Tuple[int, int]
    def cleanup_temporary_arrays(self)
```

### Parallel Processing
- **Operation Parallelism**: Independent operations in sequence
- **Data Parallelism**: Process image regions in parallel
- **Pipeline Parallelism**: Overlap I/O with computation
- **Batch Parallelism**: Process multiple images concurrently

## Specific Optimizations

### Critical Path Optimizations
1. **PixelFilter**: Use NumPy boolean indexing instead of loops
2. **RowShift/ColumnShift**: Use NumPy roll and advanced indexing
3. **BlockFilter**: Optimize block extraction with array views
4. **GeometricOps**: Pre-compute coordinate transformation maps

### Memory Efficiency Improvements
1. **Lazy Loading**: Load image data only when needed
2. **Memory Pooling**: Reuse allocated arrays across operations
3. **Streaming Processing**: Process images larger than available RAM
4. **Reference Counting**: Track image copies to minimize memory usage

### Cache System Optimizations
1. **Hash Computation**: Fast hashing algorithms for cache keys
2. **Compression**: Compress cached results to save disk space
3. **Memory Cache**: LRU cache for frequently accessed results
4. **Background Cleanup**: Asynchronous cache maintenance

## Profiling and Monitoring
```python
class PerformanceProfiler:
    def profile_operation(self, operation, test_images) -> ProfileResult
    def benchmark_pipeline(self, pipeline, iterations=10) -> BenchmarkResult
    def memory_profile(self, pipeline) -> MemoryProfile
    def generate_report(self) -> str
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Execution Time**: Per-operation and total pipeline timing
- **Memory Usage**: Peak and average memory consumption
- **Cache Performance**: Hit rates and lookup times
- **Throughput**: Images processed per second
- **Scalability**: Performance vs. image size relationships

## Memory Management Utilities

### Smart Memory Allocation
- Monitor system memory availability
- Suggest optimal chunk sizes for large images
- Implement memory pressure callbacks
- Provide memory usage warnings

### Large Image Handling
```python
def process_large_image(image_path, operations, chunk_size=None):
    """Process images larger than available RAM in chunks."""
    if chunk_size is None:
        chunk_size = calculate_optimal_chunk_size()

    # Process image in overlapping chunks
    # Merge results seamlessly
```

## Parallel Processing Framework
```python
class ParallelProcessor:
    def __init__(self, max_workers=None):
        self.max_workers = max_workers or cpu_count()

    def process_operations_parallel(self, operations, context):
        """Execute independent operations in parallel."""

    def process_regions_parallel(self, operation, image, regions):
        """Process image regions in parallel for single operation."""
```

### Threading Strategy
- **I/O Threading**: Separate threads for image loading/saving
- **CPU Threading**: Parallel processing for CPU-intensive operations
- **Process Pool**: Use multiprocessing for truly independent work
- **Async Integration**: Support for async/await patterns

## Benchmarking Framework
```python
def benchmark_operation(operation_class, test_cases, iterations=100):
    """Benchmark operation performance across various scenarios."""

def memory_profile_pipeline(pipeline, test_image):
    """Profile memory usage throughout pipeline execution."""

def scalability_test(operation, image_sizes):
    """Test how operation performance scales with image size."""
```

## Configuration Options
Add performance-related configuration:
```yaml
performance:
  max_memory_usage: "2GB"
  parallel_workers: 4
  chunk_size: "auto"
  cache_compression: true
  enable_profiling: false
```

## Success Criteria
