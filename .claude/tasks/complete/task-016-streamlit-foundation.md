# Task 016: Streamlit UI Foundation âœ… COMPLETE

## Status: COMPLETED
- âœ… Basic Streamlit app structure implemented
- âœ… Image upload and display functionality working
- âœ… Session state management implemented
- âœ… Basic pipeline integration functional
- âœ… Error handling and user feedback working
- âœ… Launch script and documentation created

## Objective
Create the foundational structure for a real-time Streamlit web interface that will replace the CLI, providing an intuitive visual pipeline builder for image processing operations.

## Requirements
1. Set up basic Streamlit application structure
2. Implement image upload and display functionality
3. Create session state management for pipeline data
4. Add basic navigation and layout components
5. Integrate with existing Pipeline and Operation classes

## File Structure to Create
```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ streamlit_app.py      # Main Streamlit application entry point

â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image_viewer.py   # Image display and comparison components
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.py         # App layout and navigation
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ session.py        # Session state management utilities

â”‚       â””â”€â”€ image_utils.py    # Image processing helpers for UI
```

## Core Features

### Main Application (`streamlit_app.py`)
- Initialize Streamlit app with proper configuration
- Set up page layout with sidebar and main content areas
- Implement image upload functionality
- Basic pipeline execution and result display

### Image Management
- Support common image formats (PNG, JPG, WebP, etc.)
- Image upload with drag-and-drop interface
- Display original and processed images side-by-side
- Image download functionality for processed results

### Session State Management
- Maintain pipeline state across UI interactions
- Store uploaded images and processing results
- Handle pipeline operations list and parameters
- Cache processed images for performance

### Layout Components
- Header with app title and basic controls
- Sidebar for operation controls and parameters
- Main content area for image display
- Footer with processing status and controls

## Technical Implementation

### Streamlit Configuration
```python
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Pixel Perfect - Image Processing",
    page_icon="ðŸŽ¨",
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded"
)
```

### Session State Schema
```python
if 'pipeline_operations' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.pipeline_operations = []
if 'original_image' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.original_image = None
if 'processed_image' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.processed_image = None
if 'processing_results' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.processing_results = {}
```

### Image Upload Integration
- Use `st.file_uploader` for image selection
- Validate file types and sizes
- Convert uploaded files to PIL Image objects
- Store in session state for pipeline processing

### Pipeline Integration
- Import existing Pipeline class
- Create Pipeline instances with session state data
- Execute pipelines with progress indicators
- Handle errors gracefully with user feedback

## Dependencies
- Add `streamlit` to project dependencies
- Create new console script entry point: `pixel-perfect-ui`
- Update pyproject.toml with Streamlit dependency

## UI Layout Design

### Header Section
- App title and version
- Quick action buttons (Reset, Download, Help)
- Processing status indicator

### Sidebar (Left Panel)
- File upload widget
- Basic operation controls placeholder
- Pipeline summary display

### Main Content Area
- Image comparison view (Before/After)
- Processing results and metadata
- Error messages and warnings

### Footer
- Processing time and performance metrics
- Memory usage information
- Export options

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Streamlit app loads and displays properly
- [ ] Image upload functionality works with common formats
- [ ] Session state maintains data across interactions
- [ ] Basic Pipeline integration executes simple operations
- [ ] UI is responsive and user-friendly
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback
- [ ] Images display correctly with proper scaling
- [ ] App can be launched via console script

## Test Cases to Implement
- **App Launch Test**: Verify Streamlit app starts without errors
- **Image Upload Test**: Upload various image formats and sizes
- **Session Persistence Test**: Data persists across page interactions
- **Pipeline Integration Test**: Basic pipeline execution works
- **UI Responsiveness Test**: Layout works on different screen sizes

## Dependencies
- Builds on: All previous tasks (Pipeline and Operations framework)
- Required: streamlit package
- Blocks: Task 017 (Operation Selector Interface)

## Notes
- This is the foundation for the visual pipeline builder
- Focus on core functionality and solid architecture
- UI polish will come in subsequent tasks
- Ensure existing Pipeline/Operation code works without modification
